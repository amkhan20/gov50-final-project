# Shifted Focus

I have shifted my focus due to a lack of data on my initial project idea.  

## Variable Descriptions

tmathssk - cumulative math scaled score

treadssk - cumulative reading scaled score

classk - type of class, factor with varying levels (regular/small.class/regular.with.aide)

totexpk - cumulative years of teaching experience

sex - boy/girl

freelunk - qualified for free lunch?

race - white/black/other

schidkn - school indicator variable

# Data Background

This data was collected through a cross-sectional study from 1985-1989 under the STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio) initiative that randomly assigned these students into 3 groups of varying class sizes: small (13-17 students per teacher), regular (22-25 students per teacher), & regular w/ aide (22-25 students along with a full-time teacher's aide). Teachers were also randomly assigned a classroom to instruct, and this study conducted the experiment with kindergarten students until the end of their third grade.
